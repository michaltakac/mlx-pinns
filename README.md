# Apple's mlx & physics-informed neural networks

Small experiments around using Apple's new mlx framework for writing physics-informed neural newtorks.

First, I'm trying to rewrite this example: https://github.com/nanditadoloi/PINN/blob/main/solve_PDE_NN.ipynb

This might be a start of AI-driven engineering, optimized for Apple silicon (think super fast engineering simulations on MacBooks).
